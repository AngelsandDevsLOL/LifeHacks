        <p>Coping with PTSD is like living in two worlds at once. There are moments when I'm right here, and then suddenly I'm back in that place, feeling everything all over again. Nightmares are a regular thing, and crowded places trigger panic. It's hard to explain to people why certain things set me off. Therapy helps, but progress is slow. Some days, just getting out of bed feels like a victory. I'm lucky to have a few friends who understand, but it's still isolating. Despite the challenges, I'm holding onto the hope that one day, the past won't have such a tight grip on me and I can finally breathe freely.</p>
